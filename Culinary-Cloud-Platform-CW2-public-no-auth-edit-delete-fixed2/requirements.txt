PROBLEM DEFINITION
Modern food lovers share their recipes and cooking experiences
across multiple platforms, from Instagram photos to YouTube
cooking videos. But these are scattered, inconsistent, and lack a
unified experience.
There is no dedicated space where users can combine recipes,
photos, videos, and voice notes within one accessible and scalable
platform.

 Challenges Identified
Multimedia storage issues: Handling large volumes of images, videos, and
audio efficiently.
Scalability: Traditional web hosting cannot dynamically handle high traffic
during peak activity (e.g., viral recipes).
Data management: Storing and querying user posts, comments, and tags
requires a distributed, flexible database.
Global accessibility: Users from different regions expect fast content delivery
with minimal latency.


To design a cloud-native platform for sharing and engaging with
multimedia recipes, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and global
reach using Azure services.
AIM & OBJECTIVES

accessibility.                                                                       u

6. Ensure monitoring and optimization using Azure Application Insights and
cost-control strategies.
CLOUD-NATIVE JUSTIFICATION
Building the Culinary Cloud Platform as a cloud-native application ensures scalability, high
availability, and cost efficiency while minimizing operational overhead.


 Elastic Scalability: Azure Functions automatically scale up during peak recipe uploads and scale
 down when traffic is low - saving costs.

 Efficient Multimedia Storage: Azure Blob Storage provides durable, pay-as-you-go storage for
 photos, videos, and audio files.

 Event-Driven Architecture: Azure Event Grid triggers background automation like generating
 thumbnails or voice-to-text transcripts.

 Serverless Deployment: No need for manual server management — Functions, Static Web Apps, and
 Logic Apps handle infrastructure automatically.

 Global Availability: Azure CDN and Cosmos DB’s geo-replication ensure fast, reliable content delivery
 worldwide.

                                                                                               TECH COMPANY

MAIN PAGE                                                     UPLOAD PAGE




The main page lets users browse, search, and share recipes   Users can create and manage recipes by adding titles,
easily with a clean, user-friendly layout.                   details, and media, with options to save drafts before
                                                             publishing.
    DATA MODEL AND SCHEMA DESIGN
Key Entities
   User – Stores user credentials, profile image, role, and personal
   details.
   Post (Recipe) – Main table containing title, description, category,
   and metadata such as likes and comments count.
   Ingredient – Lists ingredients for each recipe with quantity and unit
   details.
   Instruction – Defines step-by-step preparation with optional linked
   media.
   Media – Stores URLs and metadata of uploaded files (image, video,
   or audio).
   Comment – Allows users to provide feedback on recipes, linked to
   both post and user.


Relationships
   User → Post: One-to-Many (each user can publish multiple recipes).
   Post → Ingredient / Instruction / Media / Comment: One-to-Many
   relationships.
   User → Comment: One-to-Many (users can comment on multiple
   recipes).
   All connections use foreign keys (FK) to ensure referential integrity.


Storage Approach
   Azure Cosmos DB stores the structured recipe, comment, and user
   data as JSON documents.
   Azure Blob Storage holds multimedia content like photos, videos,
   and audio linked by file URLs.
   Each post references its media and related entities through unique       This structure ensures efficient data storage, easy retrieval, and scalability across
   IDs for efficient retrieval.                                             Azure services.
REST API AND DATA FLOW DESIGN
The REST API is implemented using Azure Functions with HTTP triggers, enabling a serverless backend that handles
CRUD operations for recipes, comments, and media files. Each request is authenticated, validated, and routed to the
appropriate data store (Cosmos DB or Blob Storage).
                                                                                         Serverless REST API design enabling secure CRUD operations via Azure Functions

Data Flow Explanation
 1.User Action: User uploads or views a recipe from the web app.                                                                                      Azure Event
                                                                                                                                                         Grid
 2.Frontend (Azure Static Web App): Sends an HTTP request to Azure Functions (API layer).
 3.Azure Functions: Processes request → validates → interacts with data sources.
      For media uploads → stores file in Blob Storage.                                                                        Logic App
                                                                                                                            (Async Tasks)
      For recipe or comment data → writes/reads from Cosmos DB.
 4.Azure Event Grid (Async Trigger): On new upload, triggers background automation
   (thumbnail or AI tagging).
 5.Response: Function returns a JSON response to the frontend for rendering.
EVENT-DRIVEN WORKFLOW
AND AUTOMATION
The Culinary Cloud Platform uses an event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous background
processes such as: Generating image thumbnails, Extracting audio transcripts, Tagging recipes using AI,
Sending notifications or updates to users.
This reduces manual workload and improves system responsiveness.

1.User Uploads Media:
   The user uploads a recipe photo, video, or voice note.
                                                                                        Azure Blob
    Azure Functions stores the file in Azure Blob Storage.                            Storage (New
                                                                                                                 Azure Cognitive
                                                                                                              Services (AI Tagging /
                                                                                      File Uploaded)             Speech-to-Text)
2.Event Trigger (Blob Created):                                                               (BlobCreated
                                                                                                  Event)
   The Blob Storage event (BlobCreated) automatically triggers Azure Event Grid.
3.Automation Execution:
   Azure Logic App (or another Azure Function) runs background tasks like:                                     Azure                   Notification

                                                                                                           Functions (API
                                                                                                             Gateway)
                                                                                                                                       or Updated
                                                                                         Grid                                             Recipe
      Call Azure Cognitive Services for AI tagging or speech-to-text                                                                   Displayed to
                                                                                                                                           User
      Send a notification to the user
 4.Data Update:
   Once automation completes, Logic App updates Azure Cosmos DB (adds                                       Azure Cosmos
   thumbnail URL/ AI tags).                                                                                  DB (Update
                                                                                                              Metadata)
 5.User Feedback
   Frontend fetches the updated data via REST API to show the enhanced recipe card.    Event-driven workflow automates background tasks like
                                                                                       media processing, AI tagging, and data updates using Azure
                                                                                       Event Grid and Logic Apps.
